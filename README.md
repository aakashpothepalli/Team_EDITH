Reimagining medical tourism in India. 

By Team E.D.I.T.H, for IEEE's HACKtheCRISIS, 2021.

## What does this project consist of?

***Swasth*** seeks to bring together 3 entities: the *patient* (medical tourist), the *hospital/doctor*, and the *travel agency*.
- A mobile app built with **Flutter** for the patient (medical tourist).
- A web-app built with **React** for the hospital/doctor and travel agency. 

Our backend involves **NodeJS**, and is hosted on **Glitch**. We have used **Deta.sh** for the database.
